//! Common types for system clocks
//!
//! This module defines types that are helpful for working with system clocks.


/// Represents a number of ticks of a given clock
///
/// This struct is used to represent an amount of time, a duration, but in a
/// low-level way that hardware peripherals can understand and handle. It is
/// meant to be a common denominator that higher-level time APIs can be built on
/// top of.
pub struct Ticks<'clock, C: 'clock> {
    /// The number of ticks
    pub value: u32,

    /// Reference to the clock
    ///
    /// For many clocks, it's possible to change their frequency. If this were
    /// to be done after an instance of `Ticks` had been created, that would
    /// invalidate the `Ticks` instance, as the same number of ticks would
    /// suddenly represent a different duration of time.
    ///
    /// This reference exists to prevent this. Any change to the configuration
    /// of a clock would presumably require a mutable reference, which means as
    /// long as this shared reference to the clock exists, the compiler will
    /// prevent the clock frequency from being changed.

/// Implemented by clocks that can return a frequency
///
/// Implementations of this trait might be very simple, for clocks that run at
/// one specific frequency. Or they might be more complex, for clocks whose
/// frequency can be configured.
///
/// Some clocks might not have an implementation of this trait at all. An
/// example of this might be a type that represents an external clock that is
/// fed into the microcontroller via a pin.

/// Marker trait that identifies a clock as currently being enabled
///
/// A clock that is always enabled can just implement this trait
/// unconditionally. Clocks that can be disabled can use a different type or a
/// type parameter to implement this trait conditionally.
///
/// HAL users will typically use this trait to ensure that a clock that is
/// passed as a parameter is enabled.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// This is a function that takes a clock. The function uses this trait to
/// ensure the passed clock is enabled.
///
/// ``` rust
/// use lpc81x::clock;
///
/// fn use_clock<C>(clock: C) where C: clock::Frequency + clock::Enabled {
///     // do something with the clock
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The following example shows how to use a type parameter to track whether a
/// clock is enabled, and implement the `Enabled` trait conditionally.
///
/// ``` rust
/// use lpc81x::{
///     clock,
///     init_state,
/// };
///
///
/// struct MyClock<State> {
///     _state: State,
/// }
///
/// impl MyClock<init_state::Disabled> {
///     /// Consume the instance with disabled state, return one with enabled
///     /// state.
///     pub fn enable(self) -> MyClock<init_state::Enabled> {
///         // Enable the clock
///         // ...
///
///         MyClock {
///             _state: init_state::Enabled(()),
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl clock::Enabled for MyClock<init_state::Enabled> {}
/// ```
