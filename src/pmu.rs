/// [`pmu::Parts`]. You can use [`PMU::split`] to gain access to [`pmu::Parts`].

/// You can also use this struct to gain access to the raw peripheral using
/// [`PMU::free`]. This is the main reason this struct exists, as it's no longer
/// possible to do this after the API has been split.
///
/// Use [`Peripherals`] to gain access to an instance of this struct.

/// Please refer to the [module documentation] for more information.
