/// Main API to control for controlling pins
///
/// `Pin` has two type parameters:
/// - `T`, to indicate which specific pin this instance of `Pin` represents (so,
///   [`PIO0_0`], [`PIO0_1`], and so on)
/// - `S`, to indicate which state the represented pin is currently in
///
/// A pin instance can be in one of the following states:
/// - [`pin_state::Unused`], to indicate that the pin is currently not used
/// - [`pin_state::Gpio`], to indicate that the pin is being used for
///   general-purpose I/O
/// - [`pin_state::Swm`], to indicate that the pin is available for switch
///   matrix function assignment
/// - [`pin_state::Adc`], to indicate that the pin is being used for analog
///   input
///
/// # State Management
///
/// All pins start out their initial state, as defined in the user manual. To
/// prevent us from making mistakes, only the methods that induce a valid state
/// transition are available. Code that tries to call a method that would cause
/// an invalid state transition will simply not compile:
///
/// ``` no_run
/// # use lpc81x::Peripherals;
/// #
/// # let mut p = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
/// #
/// # let mut swm = p.SWM.split();
/// #
/// // Assign a function to a pin
/// let (clkout, pio0_12) = swm.movable_functions.clkout.assign(
///     swm.pins.pio0_12.into_swm_pin(),
///     &mut swm.handle,
/// );
///
/// // As long as the function is assigned, we can't use the pin for
/// // general-purpose I/O. Therefore the following method call would cause a
/// // compile-time error.
/// // let pio0_12 = pio0_12.into_gpio_pin(&p.GPIO);
/// ```
///
/// To use the pin in the above example for GPIO, we first have to unassign the
/// movable function and transition the pin to the unused state:
///
/// ``` no_run
/// # use lpc81x::Peripherals;
/// #
/// # let mut p = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
/// #
/// # let mut swm = p.SWM.split();
/// #
/// # let (clkout, pio0_12) = swm.movable_functions.clkout.assign(
/// #     swm.pins.pio0_12.into_swm_pin(),
/// #     &mut swm.handle,
/// # );
/// #
/// let (clkout, pio0_12) = clkout.unassign(pio0_12, &mut swm.handle);
/// let pio0_12 = pio0_12.into_unused_pin();
///
/// // Now we can transition the pin into the GPIO state.
/// let pio0_12 = pio0_12.into_gpio_pin(&p.GPIO);
/// ```
///
/// # General Purpose I/O
///
/// All pins can be used for general-purpose I/O (GPIO), meaning they can be
/// used for reading digital input signals and writing digital output signals.
/// To set up a pin for GPIO use, you need to call [`Pin::into_gpio_pin`] when
/// it is in its unused state.
///
/// ``` no_run
/// use lpc81x::Peripherals;
///
/// let mut p = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
///
/// let mut swm = p.SWM.split();
///
/// // The pin takes a shared reference to `GPIO`, which it keeps around as long
/// // as the pin is in the GPIO state. This ensures the GPIO peripheral can't
/// // be disabled while we're still using the pin for GPIO.
/// let pin = swm.pins.pio0_12.into_gpio_pin(&p.GPIO);
/// ```
///
/// Now `pin` is in the GPIO state. The GPIO state has the following sub-states:
/// - [`direction::Unknown`], to indicate that the current GPIO configuration is
///   not known
/// - [`direction::Input`], to indicate that the pin is configured for digital
///   input
/// - [`direction::Output`], to indicate that the pin is configured for digital
///   output
///
/// To use a pin, that we previously configured for GPIO (see example above),
/// for digital output, we need to set the pin direction using
/// [`Pin::into_output`].
///
/// ``` no_run
/// # use lpc81x::Peripherals;
/// #
/// # let p = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
/// #
/// # let mut swm = p.SWM.split();
/// #
/// # let pin = swm.pins.pio0_12
/// #     .into_gpio_pin(&p.GPIO);
/// #
///
/// // Configure pin for digital output. This assumes that the pin is currently
/// // in the GPIO state.
/// let mut pin = pin.into_output();
///
/// // Now we can change the output signal as we like.
/// pin.set_high();
/// pin.set_low();
/// ```
///
/// # Fixed and Movable Functions
///
/// Besides general-purpose I/O, pins can be used for a number of more
/// specialized functions. Some of those can be used only on one specific pin
/// (fixed functions), others can be assigned to any pin (movable functions).
///
/// Before you can assign any functions to a pin, you need to transition it from
/// the unused state to the SWM state using [`Pin::into_swm_pin`].
///
/// ``` no_run
/// # use lpc81x::Peripherals;
/// #
/// # let p = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
/// #
/// # let swm = p.SWM.split();
/// #
/// let pin = swm.pins.pio0_12
///     .into_swm_pin();
///
/// // Functions can be assigned now using the methods on `Function`
/// ```
///
/// As mentioned above, a function can be fixed or movable. But there is also
/// another distinction: Functions can be input or output functions. Any number
/// of input functions can be assigned to a pin at the same time, but at most
/// one output function can be assigned to a pin at once (see user manual,
/// section 7.4). These rules are enforced by the API at compile time.
///
/// Once a pin is in the SWM state, you can assign functions to it. Please refer
/// to [`Function`] for more information on how to do that.
